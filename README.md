# UCL-Msc-Thesis
This repository includes the source codes required for my Msc thesis project about the prevalence of hayfever in UK's population. 
## Project description

## Project files
There are two folders, namely codes and datasets.
### Datasets: 
1.	features.csv: a total of 38 search queries with the same period from 5/1/2004 to 25/7/2016 were collected from Google Trend. 
2.	hayfever_ENG.csv: The RCGP data represents the number of doctor consultations reporting hayfever symptoms per 100,000 people in England. The dataâ€™s weekly time series are from January 5, 2004 to July 25, 2016. 
3.	pre. csv: The hayfever incidence estimating results from Elastic net were used as external variable put into the ARIMAX model.
### Codes: 
1. ARIMA.ipynb: ARIMA is used to analyse stationarity of series data, ACF and PACF, and gain forecasting results for five testing periods by use of hayfever_ENG.csv.
2. Elastic_net vs OLS.ipynb: Loading the data from features.csv, this file is used to obtain hayfever incidence estimating results by Elastic net, OLS regression and their performance comparison.
3. ARIMAX with Elastic net.ipynb: Inputting the estimating results from Elastic net, namely pre.csv, this file is to create a combined model of ARIMA and Elastic net: ARIMAX.
